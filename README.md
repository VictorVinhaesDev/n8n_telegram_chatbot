# Telegram chatbot
A Telegram virtual assistant.

I made it as simple and efficient as possible. I could also include the function to delete or edit events,
but since it wasn't requested, I didn't do it.

1- I chose Telegram as the chat portal.

2- I created my virtual agent called Batman to be friendly and very receptive,
even if the person doesn't ask about the events, he will inform and update them
so that the person is attentive and doesn't miss any deadlines. He also sends the meeting links to make it easier
to access.

3- I used the OpenAI model, the famous chatgpt.

5- I created a memory so that he can remember what was said in the chat.

6- I added 2 tools, one to read the events and another to create them.
